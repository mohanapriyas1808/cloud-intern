Student Information Management System

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to collect and store student information, such as name, subject, and marks, in a MySQL database. 
The frontend is built using React, the backend using Express.js, and MySQL serves as the database. 
The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and management.
